      Orginal Sountrack from the movie, "Mulan".</br>
      It is composed by Matthew Wilder, with lyrics by David Zippel for Disney's 36th animated film. The song features a voice of Captain Li </br>Shang, performed by Dornny Osmond as the they're going through a rigorous training montage, in which the young and newcomers are trying </br>to justify their own worth. The title is rather ironic as Mulan relies on her intelligence, which is proven to be mor competent than her male </br>comrades, who rely on physical strength.
