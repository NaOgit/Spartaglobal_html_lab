      Orginal Sountrack from the movie, "The Lion King".</br>
      "Hakuna Matata" is a song based on Timon and Pumbaa's catchphrase, which means 'no worries'. The song is characterised in</br> simple 4/4 time upbeat pace. Very catchy.</br>
      It was composed by Elton John, with lyrics by Tim Rice. The song features a voice of a meerkat (Timon, voiced by Nathan Lane), </br>a voice of a warthog (Pumbaa, voiced by Ernie Sabella), and a voice of a lion (Simba, voiced by Jason Weaver and Joseph WIlliams).
